Kakoune Tutor
=============

A tutor file made in the theme of *[Vimtutor](https://github.com/vim/vim/tree/master/runtime/tutor)*, for Kakoune, but written in NeoVim.
It is probably a violation of copyright or something.

I highly doubt this actually is a violation of anything,
but it is extremely similar and totally based off the original work.
Any similarities in prose are purely coÃ¯ncidental and should be assumed to be due to the regularity of English expression.


How it Works
------------

At the present time, you are intended to open it in a text editor you feel comfortable with
(like \[N\]Vim),
or in `less` and follow along with Kakoune.

I intend on writing a quirky shell script to make it function similar to Vimtutor in the future,
but nigh is not the time.


How to Get Started
------------------

I recommend creating a source code directory in your `~/Downloads`, called `.src`.

1. `mkdir -p ~/Downloads/.src`
2. `cd ~/Downloads/.src`
3. `git clone https://github.com/Matthew-Tate-Scarbrough/kaktutor.git`

Now, you may view the file any time:

4. `less`/`kak` `~/Downloads/.src/kaktutor/kaktutor.txt`


What You Can Do To Help
-----------------------

Anything, chiefly translations!
I am writing this in my free time, as I learn Kakoune, so I am not looking for any *new* material yet, unless it is on stuff that has already been typed.


What Should We **ACTUALLY** All Do To Help?
-------------------------------------------

Make some weird things about Kakoune more Vim-like ðŸ˜œ
